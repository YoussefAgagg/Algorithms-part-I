# Algorithm Time Complexity Analysis

This document provides an overview of asymptotic notation and how to measure the time complexity of algorithms using Big
O notation.

## Asymptotic Notation

Asymptotic notation is a mathematical tool used to describe the behavior of functions as their inputs grow to infinity.
It allows us to analyze the efficiency of algorithms by focusing on their growth rates rather than specific values.

### Big O Notation

Big O notation, denoted as O(f(n)), is one of the most commonly used asymptotic notations. It represents the upper bound
or worst-case scenario of the growth rate of a function. In the context of algorithm analysis, it describes the maximum
number of operations an algorithm will perform as a function of its input size.

#### Key Concepts

- The function f(n) in O(f(n)) represents the growth rate of the algorithm.
- The "O" symbol stands for "order of" or "on the order of."
- The value of n represents the input size of the algorithm.
- The Big O notation provides an upper bound estimate for the growth rate.

#### Examples

- O(1) represents constant time complexity. The algorithm's performance is unaffected by the input size.
- O(n) represents linear time complexity. The algorithm's performance grows linearly with the input size.
- O(n^2) represents quadratic time complexity. The algorithm's performance grows quadratically with the input size.

### Other Asymptotic Notations

Apart from Big O notation, there are other asymptotic notations commonly used, such as:

- Omega notation (Ω): Represents the lower bound or best-case scenario of the growth rate.
- Theta notation (Θ): Represents both the upper and lower bounds, providing a tight estimate of the growth rate.

## Algorithm Time Measurement in Big O

When measuring the time complexity of an algorithm using Big O notation, follow these steps:

1. Identify the input size: Determine the parameter that affects the algorithm's performance, typically denoted as n.

2. Count the dominant operations: Identify the most significant operations within the algorithm that contribute to its
   overall time consumption. Ignore constants and focus on the operations that grow the fastest as n increases.

3. Express the growth rate using Big O notation: Use the count of dominant operations to express the algorithm's time
   complexity using the appropriate Big O notation. Remove the insignificant terms and constants from the expression.

4. Validate the result: Analyze the algorithm's behavior for different input sizes and verify that the chosen Big O
   notation accurately represents its growth rate.

## Conclusion

Understanding asymptotic notation, particularly Big O notation, is crucial for analyzing and comparing the efficiency of
different algorithms. By measuring the time complexity of algorithms using Big O notation, you can make informed
decisions about algorithm selection, optimization, and scalability.
