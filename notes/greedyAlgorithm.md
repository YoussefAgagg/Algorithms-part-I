# Greedy Algorithm

## Overview

The Greedy Algorithm is a simple approach used in optimization problems to make locally optimal choices at each step,
with the aim of finding the global optimum. It belongs to the class of algorithmic paradigms known as "Greedy
Techniques."

## Algorithm Description

The Greedy Algorithm follows a step-by-step process to find an optimal solution. At each step, it makes the most
advantageous choice based on the available information, without considering the potential consequences of that choice on
future steps. The algorithm assumes that a sequence of locally optimal decisions will lead to an overall optimal
solution.

## Pseudocode

The pseudocode for the Greedy Algorithm can be outlined as follows:

```
function GreedyAlgorithm(input):
    solution = empty
    while termination condition is not met:
        select the best element x from input
        add x to the solution
        update input by removing elements affected by the choice of x
    return solution
```

## Example

Let's consider an example to illustrate the Greedy Algorithm. We have a set of coins with different denominations, and
we want to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount of change.

```
Input:
- Available coins: [1, 5, 10, 25]
- Amount of change: 47

Output:
- Solution: [25, 10, 10, 1, 1]
```

In this example, the Greedy Algorithm works as follows:

1. At the first step, the algorithm selects the largest coin less than or equal to the remaining change, which is 25.
2. The algorithm adds 25 to the solution and subtracts 25 from the remaining change, resulting in 22.
3. The process continues, and the algorithm selects the largest coin less than or equal to the remaining change, which
   is 10.
4. The algorithm adds 10 to the solution and subtracts 10 from the remaining change, resulting in 12.
5. The algorithm repeats the process until the termination condition is met, and the final solution
   is [25, 10, 10, 1, 1].

## Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the Greedy Algorithm depends on the specific problem and its implementation. In some
cases, the Greedy Algorithm can provide an optimal solution in a relatively efficient manner. However, it is important
to note that the Greedy Algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution for all problems and may require additional
checks or modifications to ensure correctness.

## Conclusion

The Greedy Algorithm is a simple yet powerful approach used in optimization problems. By making locally optimal choices
at each step, it aims to find an overall optimal solution. While it may not always provide the best solution, it can be
an effective strategy for certain types of problems.
